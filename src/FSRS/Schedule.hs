-- | This is an intermediate card update value which is for internal to scheduling module only.
-- | This is used to keep the actual update functions purely focused on changes to the card, so:
-- | 1) allowing the time values to be relative (actual dates handled by caller)
-- | 2) the updated interval is handed back, so fuzzing can occur. Fuzzing requires IO since it needs randomness
-- | 3) the review log doesn't need to be in the core calculation
-- | manipulated for fuzzing.
