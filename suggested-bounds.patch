Resolving dependencies...

The following packages need bounds and here is a suggested starting point.
You can copy and paste this into the build-depends section in your .cabal
file and it should work (with the appropriate removal of commas).

Note that version bounds are a statement that you've successfully built and
tested your package and expect it to work with any of the specified package
versions (PROVIDED that those packages continue to conform with the PVP).
Therefore, the version bounds generated here are the most conservative
based on the versions that you are currently building with. If you know
your package will work with versions outside the ranges generated here,
feel free to widen them.
